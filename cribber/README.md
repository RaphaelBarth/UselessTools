# cribber

This project enables the duplication of a given text file into a new file character by character, simulating human input. This prevents your computer from entering rest mode and ensures an accurate copy of the text.

### HOWTO USE

To use the cribber.py script, simply execute it and click on the text.txt file to focus it. The script will stop copying as soon as the text.txt file loses focus to prevent accidental input.
If needed, you can make small adjustments to the script by changing the parameters at the top of the file.
- DELAY: Measured in seconds, this is the time we wait between characters before entering the next.
- FILE_PATH: Here, you have the option to switch the input file that the script should copy.
- DESTENATION: Choose the destination file to which you want to copy your file.
